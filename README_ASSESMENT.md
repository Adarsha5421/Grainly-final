## 🔧 Technical Implementation: How the Magic Works

### **JWT Token Signing: The Digital Handshake**
```javascript
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "7d" });
```

### **Multi-Factor Authentication: Double the Protection**
```javascript
if (user.twoFactorEnabled) {
  if (!twoFactorCode) return res.status(206).json({ twoFactorRequired: true });
  const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({ 
    secret: user.twoFactorSecret, 
    encoding: "base32", 
    token: twoFactorCode 
  });
  if (!verified) return res.status(400).json({ msg: "Invalid 2FA code" });
}
```

### **Rate Limiting: The Guardian at the Gate**
```javascript
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({ windowMs: 15*60*1000, max: 5 });
const signupLimiter = rateLimit({ windowMs: 60*60*1000, max: 5 });
```

### **Password Policy: Strength in Numbers**
```javascript
// Password strength indicator (frontend)
const strong = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=[\]{};':"\\|,.<>/?]).{8,}$/;
const medium = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{6,}$/;
```

### **Email Verification: Trusted Communication**
```javascript
const verifyToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
const verifyTokenHash = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(verifyToken).digest("hex");
user.emailVerifyToken = verifyTokenHash;
user.emailVerifyExpire = Date.now() + 60*60*1000; // 1 hour
```

### **CORS Configuration: Controlled Access**
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000"],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## 📊 Security Metrics: The Numbers That Tell Our Story

### **Authentication Security: The Foundation**
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with 10 rounds of encryption
- **JWT Tokens**: 7-day expiry with Bearer authentication
- **2FA Support**: TOTP via speakeasy with QR code setup
- **Email Verification**: Required for additional email addresses

### **Data Protection: Your Information, Our Responsibility**
- **Password Storage**: Securely hashed in MongoDB
- **2FA Secrets**: Base32 encoded and stored safely
- **No Explicit Encryption**: Relies on MongoDB and host security
- **TLS Configuration**: Must be enforced at deployment level

### **Monitoring & Auditing: Keeping Watch**
- **Console Logging**: Errors, failed logins, password resets
- **No External SIEM**: Basic logging without external aggregation
- **No Retention Policy**: Logs not automatically archived

---

## 🧪 Security Testing Results: Proving Our Defenses

### **Automated Testing: Quality Assurance**
- **Linting**: ESLint ensures code quality and security standards
- **Dependency Scanning**: Manual `npm audit` for vulnerability detection
- **No SAST/DAST**: No automated security testing scripts implemented

### **Manual Testing: Human Verification**
- **Password Strength**: Weak and strong passwords tested during registration
- **Rate Limiting**: Exceeded login/signup attempts, observed protection
- **2FA Implementation**: Enabled, logged in, tested TOTP enforcement
- **Email Verification**: Added new email, verified via link, tested expiry
- **RBAC Testing**: Attempted admin endpoints as non-admin user
- **JWT Tampering**: Modified token, observed 401 response
- **Blocked User**: Blocked user, attempted login, verified denial
- **Password Reset**: Used reset link, tested expiry functionality

### **Penetration Testing Considerations: Thinking Like an Attacker**
- **Authentication Bypass**: JWT validation and 2FA enforcement
- **NoSQL Injection**: Mongoose queries with input validation
- **XSS/CSRF**: JWT authentication without cookie dependencies
- **Session Hijacking**: JWT-only approach, no server-side sessions
- **Privilege Escalation**: Comprehensive isAdmin checks in all admin routes
