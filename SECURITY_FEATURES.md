# üõ°Ô∏è Grainly Security Features: Your Digital Fortress

> *Where every feature is a shield, every line of code a guardian, and every user interaction protected by layers of trust*

---

## üåü Overview: The Security Story We're Telling

Grainly isn't just another e-commerce platform‚Äîit's a digital sanctuary where security isn't an afterthought, but the very foundation upon which everything else is built. We've crafted a comprehensive security framework that protects users, secures transactions, and builds trust through technology. From the moment a user registers to their final purchase, every interaction is safeguarded by multiple layers of defense.

### ‚ú® What Makes Our Security Special

We've implemented a robust authentication, authorization, and data protection system that includes JWT-based authentication, optional TOTP-based multi-factor authentication (MFA), intelligent rate limiting, and comprehensive email verification. Passwords are securely hashed, user management includes RBAC and account blocking, and every feature is designed with security as the cornerstone.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Security Features: The Protective Arsenal

### **1. Password Security: Your First Line of Defense**
- **Strength Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters with real-time feedback
- **Hashing Algorithm**: bcryptjs with 10 rounds of encryption
- **Live Validation**: Password strength meter guides users to security
- **No Reuse Policy**: Fresh passwords for every account

### **2. Brute Force Protection: Smart Defense**
- **Rate Limiting Strategy**: 
  - Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes per IP
  - Signup attempts: 5 per hour per IP
- **Graceful Handling**: Users never get locked out, just slowed down
- **IP Tracking**: Per-IP protection prevents distributed attacks

### **3. Multi-Factor Authentication: Double the Security**
- **TOTP Implementation**: Time-based One-Time Passwords via speakeasy
- **QR Code Setup**: Easy authenticator app integration
- **Enforced Protection**: 2FA required on login when enabled
- **User Choice**: Enable or disable at user's discretion

### **4. Session Management: Secure Connections**
- **JWT Tokens**: 7-day expiry with Bearer authentication
- **Stateless Design**: No server-side session storage needed
- **Automatic Expiry**: Tokens gracefully expire and refresh

### **5. Email Verification: Trusted Communication**
- **Tokenized Links**: SHA-256 hashed verification tokens
- **Time-Sensitive**: 1-hour expiry for security
- **Required for New Emails**: Additional email addresses must be verified

### **6. Role-Based Access Control: Power to the Right People**
